TextMate Flex Bundle
====================

Provides [TextMate][] support for working with [Adobes][Adobe] [Flex][] framework (version 3.x).  

For full functionality the [ActionScript 3.tmbundle][] should also be installed.

Work Branch
-----------

Experimental branch of 'master' attempting to improve autocompletion using DIALOG2.

Possible prefixes when invoked:

	<
	<mx
	<Ar
	<mx:

As the command relies on the current document being valid xml. So a partially typed 
tag breaks it. The current solution isn't pretty and as a result the command only
works when it is invoked on a blank line with a partially type tag.

Expects the 'mx' namespace prefix to be mapped to the uri 'http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml',
if this has been changed then collision with the internally loaded mx completions
list is likely to happen. We load this list as a short cut because it's always
going to be used - and it gives us the opportunity to snippetize it.

Has to have `TM_FLEX_FILE_SPECS` specified for now - if it isn't you'll only see
mx components.
